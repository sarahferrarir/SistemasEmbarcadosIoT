# HandMouse: Hand Gesture-Based Mouse Control

HandMouse is a Python-based project that enables mouse control using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It leverages **MediaPipe Hands** for hand tracking and **PyAutoGUI** for controlling the cursor. The goal of this project is to provide a lightweight, optimized solution for gesture-based input with minimal computational requirements.

## **Features**
- Tracks hand gestures in real time using a webcam.
- Moves the mouse cursor based on the direction of the **index** and **middle fingers**.
- Smooth cursor movement with deadzone handling to avoid jumps and lag.
- Optimized for low computational power without sacrificing responsiveness.

## **System Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- A webcam (internal or external)
- Operating system:
  - Windows (optimized with DirectShow backend)
  - macOS (limited testing)
